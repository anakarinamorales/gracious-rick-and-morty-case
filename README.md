# gracious-rick-and-morty-case
This is a test applied by Gracious to measure my developer skills.

## Steps to execute
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn dev`
4. Access the page logged on your terminal

## TODO

* When a page is loaded, check if there is data to be shown.  If not, show modal with error message.
* Get all data. Currentrly, the query only gets the first page of data that come from the API. For that, use the fetchMore property from useQuery hook.
* Add jsdoc comments
* Add breadcumbs
* Include SASS
